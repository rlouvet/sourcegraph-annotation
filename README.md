Sourcegraph programming challenge
=================================

## Instructions

This challenge asks you to build a small web service. You can use any language and any third-party libraries you
like. We evaluate solutions based on simplicity and robustness.

1. Make an HTTP service that satisfies the requirements below. If anything is ambiguous, please first refer to the test script provided. Otherwise,
feel free to shoot us an email.
2. Test your service using the script provided (`test.sh`). Start your server and then follow the instructions in the script to run it against your
service. We will test your service with a different script and also on tens of thousands of names, so please write code that generalizes and scales.
3. Create a README that contains the following:
   * For each API endpoint, state its space and runtime complexities (Big O) and explain why your implementation achieves these. If you considered
   alternate implementations, explain why you chose the right one. Be clear and concise (no more than a few sentences per endpoint).
   * Include build instructions that tell us how to compile and run your program. You are welcome to use external libraries in your solution, but
   make sure they are covered by your build instructions.
4. Create a zip/tar of your solution directory and email to hiring@sourcegraph.com with the subject line, "challenge solution".

## Requirements

Create a web service that annotates HTML snippets by hyperlinking names. Names satisfy the following regex: `[A-Za-z0-9]+`. ("Bob09" is an example
name. The string "Alex.com" contains 2 names: "Alex" and "com".)

The service should expose an HTTP API that supports the following operations:

1. Create/update the link for a particular name using an HTTP `PUT` on a URL of the form `/names/[name]`. The body of the request contains JSON of the
form `{ "url": "[url goes here]" }`.
2. Fetch the information for a given name using an HTTP `GET` on a URL of the form `/names/[name]`. This should return JSON in the following format:
`{ "name": "[name goes here]", "url": "[url goes here]" }`
3. Delete all the data on an HTTP `DELETE` on the URL `/names`. (Note: data is NOT required to persist between server restarts.)
4. The `/annotate` endpoint expects a `POST` request with an HTML snippet (valid HTML on one line) in the request
body. It returns the snippet with all occurrences of linkable names hyperlinked with the link stored on the server. If a
name occurs in an existing hyperlink, then it is unchanged. No element attributes or tag names should be modified. The
returned HTML should not have any new newlines or spaces. You should only annotate complete names that are not part of a
larger name. For example, if your server contains the names "Alex" (`http://alex.com`) and "Bo" (`http://bo.com`) and
the input snippet is `Alex Alexander <a href="http://foo.com" data-Bo="Bo">Some sentence about Bo</a>`, then the
expected output is `<a href="http://alex.com">Alex</a> Alexander <a href="http://foo.com" data-Bo="Bo">Some sentence
about Bo</a>`. This endpoint should be robust and work on all valid HTML snippets, so you should use an actual HTML
parser (not just a simple regexp find-and-replace).
5. Your implementation should scale to storing tens of thousands of names and annotating snippets that are as long as a typical webpage (e.g.,
`nytimes.com`). All API endpoints at this scale should run in at most a few seconds.
6. For any endpoint that mutates state, the following contract should hold: after a client receives a response, the change should be reflected in all
subsequent API calls. E.g., if I have completed a `PUT` of a new name, I should immediately be able to `GET` it.

## Contents of this directory
- `test.sh` is the test script you can run to test your server.
- `expected_out.txt` is the expected output (used by the test script). You should run the test script in the directory that contains `expected_out.txt`.

## Other guidelines

All implementation details are up to you. You should use whatever language, tools, and libraries you are *most familiar* with. You are welcome to use
any tools or resources at your disposal (e.g., Sourcegraph, documentation, GitHub, Google Search, etc.), but the work must be your own â€“ no
collaboration with others.

Your solution should scale to deal with tens of thousands of names and serve a few annotation queries per second.

The test script cares about HTML attribute ordering. However, if your solution emits the correct HTML with attributes in a different order, that's fine.

The test script is provided to help you, but by no means covers a comprehensive set of test cases.

We estimate that this challenge should take roughly 1-2 hours to complete. Feel free to reach out to us with any questions/clarifications, and happy coding!
